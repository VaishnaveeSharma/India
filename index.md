### India's Covid-19 Story

Strict policies were imposed by government from March - mid May so the covid-19 cases and deaths were less. Indian Border were closed for the same period of time. But then the restrictions were eased upon from mid May to July. As a result very quick spread of infection took place in the entire country. Cases and deaths were increased by a large scale.
